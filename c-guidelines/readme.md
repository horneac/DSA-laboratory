# C coding guidelines

* MEANINGFULL NAMES FOR VARIABLES, CONSTANTS AND FUNCTIONS.
	 - Also don't use MAGIC numbers in your code, if possible. If you have to use a number, either its meaning is obvious, or you should define it as a constant and give it a meaningful name.
* Always use identation and curly braces. 
* Always initialize your variables.
* Consistent style (e.g. if you like to place the curly braces on the next line, then always do so, don't switch between styles).
* You should use spaces between variables and operators (give those variables some fresh air). Always have a space after a comma but not before.
* You should use blank space (empty new lines) to split your code into meaningful blocks. For example, leave a blank line after the declarations of variables at the beginning of a function, this way, it is clearly visible where the code starts and where you should look for variable declarations.
* Use parantheses for clarity when you have complex operations.
* A line should not be longer than 80 characters (it's nice when the line fits on the screen, without having to scroll to read it).
* Avoid code duplication.
* Functions should be short and clear. If a function becames too long, then you should split it.

These are some basic style guides that helps you maintain your code more readable and they can also help maintain your code bug free.
You can find a lot of style guidelines on the web, for any language.
