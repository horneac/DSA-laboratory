# DSA-laboratory

This is the page I will use for the DSA laboratory. Here you should find links to assignments and maybe other links 
I think will be usefull during the course of this lab.

### Labs

```
Lab 1: Introduction to git and Single Linked Lists
```
* Assignment 1:
	- 1.1: [Basic operations on Singly Linked Lists](https://classroom.github.com/a/ZpU-nDvV) (deadline: 27.02.2021 23:00)
	
	
### Notes
```
Some C style guidelines
```
* MEANINGFULL NAMES FOR VARIABLES, CONSTANTS AND FUNCTIONS.
	 - Also don't use MAGIC numbers in your code, if possible. If you have to use a number, either its meaning is obvious, or you should define it as a constant and give it a meaningful name.
* Always use identation and curly braces. 
* Consistent style (e.g. if you like to place the curly braces on the next line, then always do so, don't switch between styles).
* You should use blank space (empty new lines) to split your code into meaningful blocks. For example, leave a blank line after the declarations of variables at the beginning of a function, this way, it is clearly visible where the code starts and where you should look for variable declarations.
* Use parantheses for clarity when you have complex operations.
* A line should not be longer than 80 characters (it's nice when the line fits on the screen, without having to scroll to read it).
* Avoid code duplication.
* Functions should be short and clear. If a function becames too long, then you should split it.

These are some basic style guides that helps you maintain your code more readable.
You can find a lot of style guidelines on the web, for any language. 

### Git

You can find the links [here](https://github.com/horneac/DSA-laboratory/tree/main/git)

### Coding Coding Coding
```
The best way to learn to code is to code.
```

To learn and to get better at coding you have to exercise and write a lot of code to solve various problems. The lab and the assignments are just the groundwork needed to build your skills.
There are a lot of resources online for great and interesting problems.
These kind of problem solving algorithms that you find on some websites can also help you for a job interviews, where you can be asked to solve something similar.

* [CodingGame](https://codingame.com)
	- A website with an online code editor where you can write code to solve or play different games.
* [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)
	- Another website with an online code editor where you can try to solve problems usually asked at job interviews. You can also see other solutions and tips, but you should always try to think first and use them when you get stuck or in order to find a better solution.
	
Another great way to learn is helping or teaching others. So try and give some help when other colleagues need it, but don't spoon feed them the solution. Try to give them hints or guide them, but let them do the work themselves.

You should also take any chance you have to participate in any contest. It is not as hard as you think and it can be a good experience even if you don't take any prize.
Because of the pandemic, some of them may not be held this year. Some examples are CCC (Cloudflight Coding Contest), ACM and a handful of hackathons.
Also, there are contests held on the previously mentioned websites.
