# DSA-laboratory

This is the page I will use for the DSA laboratory. Here you should find links to assignments and maybe other links 
I think will be usefull during the course of this lab.

### Labs

```
Lab 1: Introduction to git and Single Linked Lists
```
* Assignment 1:
	- 1.1: https://classroom.github.com/a/ZpU-nDvV
	
	
### Notes
```
Some C style guidelines
```
* MEANINGFULL NAMES FOR VARIABLES, CONSTANTS AND FUNCTIONS.
	 - Also don't use MAGIC numbers in your code, if possible. If you have to use a number, either its meaning is obvious, or you should define it as a constant and give it a meaningful name.
* Always use identation and curly braces. 
* Consistent style (e.g. if you like to place the curly braces on the next line, then always do so, don't switch between styles).
* You should use blank space (empty new lines) to split your code into meaningful blocks. For example, leave a blank line after the declarations of variables at the beginning of a function, this way, it is clearly visible where the code starts and where you should look for variable declarations.
* Use parantheses for clarity when you have complex operations.
* A line should not be longer than 80 characters (its nice when the line fits on the screen, without having to scroll to read it).
* Avoid code duplication.
* Functions should be short and clear. If a function becames too long, then you should split it.

These are some basic style guides that helps you maintain your code more readable.
You can find a lot of style guidelines on the web, for any language. 

### Git
* create a github account: https://github.com
* git download link : https://git-scm.com/downloads
* gitextensions download link: http://gitextensions.github.io/ (my choice of GUI for using git)
